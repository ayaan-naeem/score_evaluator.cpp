## Pass/Fail Checker

A simple C++ program that determines whether a student has passed or failed based on their exam score.

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter their score.

It evaluates the score using a conditional if-else statement:

Passed if the score is 50 or above

Failed if the score is below 50

The program displays the result on the console.

## How to Run
## Step 1: Compile the code

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing pass_fail_checker.cpp, and run:

g++ pass_fail_checker.cpp -o pass_fail_checker


This will compile the code and create an executable named pass_fail_checker.

## Step 2: Run the program

On the same terminal, execute:

./pass_fail_checker


or on Windows:

pass_fail_checker.exe

## Step 3: Enter a score

Type any integer score when prompted. The program will tell you if you have Passed or Failed.

## Sample Input/Output
Enter Your Score: 75
You are Passed

Enter Your Score: 42
You are Failed
